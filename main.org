** Formal systems
"Formulate simple ideas very clearly so that one can use them as models in thinking about more complex ideas."
*** Have
**** Theorems
In formal systems /theorems/ are *produced*. 
IRL /theorems/ are statements in language shown to be true through rigour - *proven*
Hofstadter states that "Derivation is the austere cousin of proof" p38

**** Axioms
Free theorem. Given by writer of system.

**** Rules
Rules are used to create more derivations.
Hofstadter calls them rules of "inference" or "production".

*** Playing the formal system

Human's can 'play' formal systems.
Computers can't don't.

"Playing the game of any formal system can become something of an art".

**** Computers
- Mechanical
- "do it over and over without ever complaining; or feeling bored."
- unobservant
- never 'exit the system'
  - unless preprogrammed

**** People
- Not mechanical
- anxious
- observant
  - notice properties
    - e.g. all theorems begin with M
      - 'seen'
        - understood via rules
        - proved to self - via rules
- never looks for pattern
- 'infers' anything
- "never notice the most obvious of facts"
- survey
- constantly looking for patterns
*** Jumping out of the system - p37
You can think *within* or *about* a formal system.

Humans can jump out of system:
- Although sometimes need 'prompting'
- Ask questions:
  - Why haven't we succeeded?
  - Is goal possible?

**** An observation

U can not be produced by MU system:
- superficial observation - "first letter test"
  - all theorems begin with M
  - of limited usefulness
    - only detects some not all non-theorems
    - there may be lots of strings that begin with M that can't be produced
*** Decision procedures
- Test for theoremhood
- Guarnteed to complete in finite amount of time
- "concrete characterisation of of the nature of all theorems in the system."
- characterisation may not be complete
  - infinite time - not quite concrete enough to be decision procedure
- Should be *guaranteed to terminate"


** The MU-puzzle

*** A simple formal system with 4 rules

Theorems are made up of the symbols M, U and I.

1. If t ends with I, U can be added to the end.
2. If t has form Mx then Mxx can be derived.
3. If III is present it can be replaced with a U
4. If UU is present it can be dropped.
   
"there is nothing to dictate which rule you should use"

"'x' is not part of the formal system in the same way..." it stands for an arbitrary string.

Hofstadter calls these rules of *production* or *inference*.

**** imo Each rule can be split in to two stages - *inference* and *production*?

| Inference   | Production     |
|-------------+----------------|
| ends with U | append I       |
| has form Mx | Mxx            |
| find III    | replace with U |
| find UU     | drop UU        |

***** TODO Confirm inference and production are good words

- Inference :: Detect affordances
- Production :: Exploit affordances
 

**** Rules in this system are lengthening and shortening

*** Jumping out of the MU-puzzle
Human's have "insights"

- after generating strings at random person may notice all theorems begin with M.
  - human would know system incapable of creating theorem 'U' - wild goose chase
- anxiety may build when playing
  - resulting in jumping out - to "take stock"

**** Possible outside system thoughts a human could have
- Use English
- sketch ideas
- work backwards
- use short hand - e.g. letter 'x'
- compress several steps into 1
- modify rules to see what it gives
- Notice numbers might pay role
  - Double length, delete in 2s 3s

* Tree Kernels: Quantifying Similarity Among Tree-Structured Data
:PROPERTIES:
"quantifiable measurements of treaes similarities"
Used in classifiers
** The curse of dimensionality
"the more the dimensions of input, the more likely the data is sparse."
A sparse data set doesn't make a good classifier.
** Kernel Methods
 - measurement of similarity betweeen pairs of items
 - linear relation in a feature space
 - "equivalent to taking the dot product of two data points in the feature space.

*** TODO remind self of dot product and positive semidefinite.
*** Kernel functions
- Symetric
- positive semidefinite
- inputs data from its origanal space
- computable in polynomial time over size of the tree
- detect isomorphic graphs
**** Huge feature space can be analyzed with less complexity
Dependant on kernal function instead of size of fetaure space
**** TODO Kernal matrix
- size always n x n
- all analysis performed over this
