** Formal systems
*** Have
**** Theorems
In formal systems /theorems/ are *produced*. 
IRL /theorems/ are statements in language shown to be true through rigour - *proven*
Hofstadter states that "Derivation is the austere cousin of proof" p38

**** Axioms
Free theorem. Given by writer of system.

**** Rules
Rules are used to create more derivations.
Hofstadter calls them rules of "inference" or "production".

** The MU-puzzle
*** A simple formal system with 4 rules
Theorems are made up of the symbols M, U and I.

1. If t ends with I, U can be added to the end.
2. If t has form Mx then Mxx can be derived.
3. If III is present it can be replaced with a U
4. If UU is present it can be dropped.

Hofstadter calls these rules of *production* or *inference*.

**** imo Each rule can be split in to two stages - *inference* and *production*?

| Inference   | Production     |
|-------------+----------------|
| ends with U | append I       |
| has form Mx | Mxx            |
| find III    | replace with U |
| find UU     | drop UU        |

***** TODO Confirm inference and production are good words
Wonder if evaluation/analysis trumps inference?

- Inference :: Detect affordances
- Production :: Exploit affordances

*** Playing the formal system

Human's 'play' formal systems.
Computers don't.

**** Computers
- Mechanical
- 'do it over and over without ever complaining; or feeling bored.

**** People
- Not mechanical
